# tExiled
tExiled is a modern take on a API Interface for **tModLoader** Terraria Servers.


It takes a lot of insperation from a project called tShock, which is for vannilla Terraria Servers.
In no way is tExiled here to replace tShock, but we are here to provide a API Interface towards Modded Servers.

## In Development
tExiled is currently not **release ready**, and will not be for a little while. It's main core features of plugin loading and injecting into tModLoader is there, but there isn't much of an API Interface. That's the only thing we are working on, thanks.
