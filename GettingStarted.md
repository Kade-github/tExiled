## I am a **Developer**
If you wish to make plugins on tExiled it's also a pretty easy setup, if you don't want a tExiledServer but you just want the api interfance,
download it from [here (hosted on https://kadedev.software/)](https://kadedev.software/downloads/tExiled)

### Step 1
Download the latest release as described from above, or use the 'Not Developer' tutorial on how to download a server.

### Step 2
Go ahead and use your perfered IDE, and then reference the tExiled.dll in your project. You should also reference the tExiled_Events.dll to gain access to events in your project as well.

### Step 3
Please look at how an example plugin would look, and also look at tExiled_Events to see how a plugin could look and should be setup as.
